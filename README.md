# Portals-in-Playcanvas
It is still in heavy development!
This code will allow you to create portals and shoot them!
If you find interest in my work!, Consider supporting me! -> ko-fi.com/thebiblecodex
-----------HOW TO USE THE SCRIPT----------------------------------------------------
-Attach the portal script to 2 entities(e.g 2 cubes stretched out as portals).**these entities must have collisions but no rigidbody**!, after that in the inspector, add the destination for each Portals and addd entities which can travel through them!, and then Run your scene. and walk through them!. 
-To shoot portals, you need to attach the portalgun.js script to the player and assign its camera within the attributes and the portals. **Note: The first portal will be shot through the left click and the other through the right click!**. To create portalable surfaces make sure to tag your surfaces with "Portalable". and your portal gun should work.
Please note this script is being developed and there will be bugs im trying to fix...Incase you find any bugs please contact me on the  playcanvas forums ->[ ](https://forum.playcanvas.com/u/potatoindivdual)
